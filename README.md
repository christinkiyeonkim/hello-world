# Hello, World! 🌎

This is Christin Kiyeon Kim  a classically trained cellist currently learning Python and IT automation.

This repository is a collection of small exercises and personal notes as I study Python through hands-on practice.  
Most of the examples come from the **Crash Course on Python** (Coursera, Google IT Support Professional Certificate) and personal experiments.

## ✍️ Notes

- I'm learning how to format strings using `{}` and `f-string`
- Practicing concepts like lists, loops, conditions, and input/output
- Working on writing cleaner and more readable code

## 🛠️ Still Learning...

This repo will grow as I continue to practice. I'm not trying to build anything perfect—I'm just trying to get better every day 🚀
